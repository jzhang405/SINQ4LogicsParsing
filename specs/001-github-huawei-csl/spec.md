**Feature Branch**: `001-github-huawei-csl`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ÊàëÈúÄË¶Å‰ΩøÁî® [GitHub - huawei-csl/SINQ: Welcome to the official repository of SINQ!

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a model developer, I want to apply SINQ quantization to the Logics-Parsing multimodal model so that I can reduce the model size while preserving accuracy for PDF parsing and multimodal tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a downloaded Logics-Parsing multimodal model in local cache, **When** I run the SINQ quantization process, **Then** I should get a quantized model with reduced file size
2. **Given** a quantized model, **When** I test it on PDF parsing and multimodal tasks, **Then** it should maintain comparable accuracy to the original model
3. **Given** the SINQ repository and paper, **When** I implement the quantization, **Then** it should follow the official SINQ methodology

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the model format is incompatible with SINQ?
- How does the system handle quantization failures?
- What if the quantized model accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load the Logics-Parsing multimodal model from the specified cache directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply SINQ quantization to reduce model size while preserving multimodal capabilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve model accuracy for PDF parsing and multimodal tasks
- **FR-004**: System MUST output the quantized model in a usable format
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate the quantized model's functionality across all modalities
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle quantization errors gracefully
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide progress feedback during quantization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Logics-Parsing Multimodal Model**: The original multimodal PDF parsing model that needs quantization
- **SINQ Quantized Model**: The optimized model with reduced size and preserved multimodal accuracy
- **Quantization Parameters**: Configuration settings for the SINQ quantization process
