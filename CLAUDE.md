## Project Overview

This repository contains the SINQ4LogicsParsing project, which uses SINQ for Alibaba Logics-Parsing. The project is currently in its initial setup phase with basic repository files.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new Python project, typical development commands would include:
- Setting up a Python virtual environment
- Installing dependencies (once requirements.txt or pyproject.toml is created)
- Running tests (once test files are added)

## Repository Structure

Currently contains:
- README.md: Project description
- LICENSE: Project license
- .gitignore: Python-specific ignore patterns

As this project develops, this file should be updated with:
- Build, test, and lint commands
- Code architecture details
- Development workflow information
