# SINQ4LogicsParsing Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow consistent style guidelines with automated linting and formatting. Code reviews MUST enforce readability, maintainability, and adherence to established patterns. Every function MUST have clear documentation and follow single responsibility principle. Code duplication MUST be eliminated through abstraction and reuse.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. All new features MUST include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Test coverage MUST exceed 80% for critical paths. Contract tests MUST validate API specifications before implementation.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces and APIs MUST maintain consistent behavior, error handling, and response formats. All user-facing features MUST include clear documentation and intuitive workflows. Performance degradation MUST be measured and prevented through monitoring and optimization.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features MUST meet defined performance targets including response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance testing MUST be integrated into the development lifecycle. Critical paths MUST be optimized for efficiency and scalability.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Gates
- Automated linting and formatting on every commit
- Code review required for all changes
- Documentation requirements for public APIs
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Requirements
- All tests MUST pass
- Code coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds
- Linting and formatting MUST be enforced
- Performance benchmarks MUST be maintained

### Release Requirements
- All automated tests MUST pass
- Performance regression tests MUST succeed
- Security scans MUST complete without critical issues
- Documentation MUST be updated and accurate

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require documentation of rationale, approval from project maintainers, and migration plan for existing code. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity MUST be justified with clear business value. Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance.
